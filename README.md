I am an Information Technologies enthusiast.
I have been studying this subject since highschool and i'm now following a different, altough similar, path which is User Experience, User Interface and Human Computer Interaction.

I got my highschool diploma in a Technical-Industrial institute.
The focus of the course i've followed was IT, especially programming (C#, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, Java Script) and system management where I got to build and manage small and medium size networks.
Thanks to my school I was able to get a CISCO's diploma in CCNA Routing and Switching: Introduction to Networks.

I am now studying UX and UI design at University, because I'm very interested in understanding the dynamics between humans and computers to create a better experience for the end user.

In my HS years i had the chance to go abroad out of my comfort zone; thanks to my school i was able to study English proficiently two times in the south of England.
Thanks to the ROTARY Club i had the chance to discover different cultures in many european countries (Austria, Slovakia and Danmark) with many other people around the globe.
With these experiences I was able to get a certified B2 level (Cambridge) and I also got the opportunity to understand the importance of relating with other cultures and to get out of your comfort zone.
